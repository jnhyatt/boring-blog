## This is a boring blog.

I like making games, but that's about the only fun thing about my interests. I really like to talk about *design*. In fact, I think about design so much that I get design paralysis. I can't write any code because I'm worried I won't design it *perfectly* right from the start.

Needless to say, this is a terrible mindset to have. My goal for this blog is to improve my ability to simply write code and accept that I might blow it all away. My posts will often be streams of consciousness focused on laying out my projects' goals and non-goals and getting prototypes ready quickly. Basically, this blog is to keep me accountable. And hopefully someone somewhere will enjoy following the development of whatever shenanigans I get into.
