## This is my boring dev log.

This is where I'll post about stuff I'm working on and things I find some level
of interesting. I know it's all boring because my wife falls asleep when I tell
her about it.

My newest obsession is Rust, but I'll happily talk your ear off about language
design, games, space, or math if you'll let me.
